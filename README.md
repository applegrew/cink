Introduction
------------

CInk is an interpreter for the [CFDG language][cfdg], an accronym for Context Free Design Grammar. To be precise, CInk implements [CFDG2][cfdg2], since it supports a lot of things which the original language doesn't have. CInk is not the first interpreter of this language though. The other named, ContextFree (Yeah! its name is a terse version of the language's name), is a standalone product developed in C language. CInk, on the other hand, is written purely in Javascript, and thus, allows you to compile and run CFDG programs in the browser itself. In addition it is also modular.
